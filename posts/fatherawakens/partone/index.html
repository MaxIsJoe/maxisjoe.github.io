<div class="post-content mb-3"><p>On a golden throne a master of a world sleeps, peacefully in ignorant bless from the flames approaching his people.</p>
<p>On a golden tower a jester sings a song, humoring the guards about their approaching demise.</p>
<p>On a golden bridge a widow&rsquo;s tears falls into the river, but it joins no water and evaporates into nothingness.</p>
<p>On a golden cliff, no sun shines on it. no warmth to stop anyone from embracing the ice cold darkness from the fall.</p>
<p>The world accepted its fate as it watched everything burn from a flame that can be felt but not seen. No one can escape as they knew the master of the world had stopped giving energy to the stars and motion of the universe; There&rsquo;s no where to escape and no energy to waste trying. Everything succumbs to it&rsquo;s end and ceases it&rsquo;s existence atom by atom. The flame consumed everything in it&rsquo;s path slowly and anyone who is near it can only feel the dread of being forgotten in a void as if they have never existed, It drove everyone insane and suicidal and even the mothers abandoned their children as they foolishly looked for a way to escape this invisible flame till they ran out of energy to continue existing.</p>
<p>Everything outside the world master&rsquo;s kingdom had disappeared into nothingness, those who survived inside the golden walls of his kingdom simply turned hallow and their minds slowly started shutting down from boredom as there was nothing to simply do when the world had ended. Even when all the master&rsquo;s followers had an infinite amount of food, wine and health; they still couldn&rsquo;t bear the fact that they were stuck on a floating rock that overlooked a vacuum of black nothingness. No woman was able to bear a child and no man was able to find a reason to continue living anymore and as a result, they all looked down from above the golden cliff and waited for a sun to rise once more; but one by one have accepted the coldness of the ground as they lost track of time.</p>
<p>The guards who swore loyalty to their master were the only beings to exist with resolve to continue living as they protected him until he was awoken from his slumber or his offsprings return to him one day, they had hope that the sun would rise once more and that they&rsquo;d be able to talk to the widow on the golden bridge once more. Their wishes would come true after thousands of years of slumber as a loud explosion shook the kingdom and turned the castle into nothing but rubble, the gold turning into copper and the world materializing back to it&rsquo;s original form once more. The sun had risen once more but the guards sobbed as their master had disappeared into the rubble, they blamed themselves for failing to protect him and letting anyone attempt to assassinate the person who gave their world a reason to exist. They spent months digging through the rubble until they found him alive, golden energy surrounded his crushed body and although it protected him; it also was attacking him as well as his face looked burnt and a huge part of his skull can be seen through the burnt flesh.</p>
<p>As they picked him up to move him somewhere else to take care of him the master screamed in agony as the energy reacted negatively to the touch and yet another explosion was about to happen, but before anyone can be harmed a shining light appeared and five figures were summoned as they rushed towards the sound of agony that echoed throughout the universe, they protected the people who were near the explosion and calmed the master down as they put him back to sleep. The citizens of the kingdom protested as they didn&rsquo;t want the flames to come back and marched towards the destroyed castle to stop the figures' plans but when they arrived they knew who the mysterious figures were; they were the master&rsquo;s sons.</p>
<p>The five sons ignored the protestors and with a blink they had teleported away from the castle and brought their father to an enclosed chamber full of nothing but wires and empty cryo-tubes that are designed to upload the cognisance of a human to a machine they can control, it was dark and every sound bounced of the walls and the only light that was in the room was the warm cyan lights emitting from the monitors that was all over the room yet despite the lack of cable management the room was <em>too</em> clean.</p>
<p>The red robed son was handed the body of his sleeping father by his tall red skinned brother and everyone nodded at each other as they watched the robed son put him inside the tube and began treating their face, connecting multiple wires and medical tubes to his damaged body and treating his wounds. The father was now cryogenically frozen and his mind connected the many machines within the room, though still unconscious; the master of the world had been awoken finally. Slowly the room turned into gold and the timeline started repairing itself as everything went back to normal and everyone who disappeared from the flames returned back into existence and forgot about the events of them getting erased from existence.</p>
<p>Four out of the five sons celebrated as everything was getting slowly repaired and they had managed to stabilize their father while the red skinned son sighed in annoyance as he looked over his father, he interrupted their celebrations and reminded them why they were in this situation in the first place; it was their father&rsquo;s abandonment of this world that caused everything around him to be erased and for someone to attempt assassinating him out of anger. If the world returned back then that means that he had returned once more, but for how long? Will he continue his slumber and let this world get erased once more? or will he stay and continue this world&rsquo;s existence? He was quite the mood killer as everyone knew that he was right with every word he spoke, but they had hope that the world wasn&rsquo;t abandoned like them and that when he gains the ability to speak once more he will explain his sudden disappearance and neglect for his world and sons.</p>
<p>The red robed son beeped as an idea came over his electronic mind, he suggested that they do not wait for him to recover and would instead install a program that lets his consciousness speak to them directly, a text-to-speech program. The sons agreed but the room rumbled in protest, the father was aware of their idea despite him being asleep; for what reason? none of them knew and they took the lack of answer as a way for them to just get on with it and install the program.</p>
